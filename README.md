# Mailmerge

A ruby library for working with Microsoft Word / Open Office mailmerge documents

# Status

Rough. Right now basic fldSimple merge fields are supported with complex fields
coming soon and support for more instructions than just MERGEFIELD. 

The code is probably going to be rough as my knowledge of .docx formatting
builds...
